# Session 6: Comprehensive Test Suite Analysis & Findings

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Branch:** `feature/session-6-user-defined-functions`
**Current Errors:** 351 (baseline) → 339 (in test suite)
**Purpose:** Holistic review of entire test suite before creating PR

---

## Executive Summary

### Original Assumption (INCORRECT)
- **Priority 5 claimed:** User-defined function return types don't work
- **Reality:** User-defined function return type inference **ALREADY WORKS PERFECTLY**

### Actual Findings (CRITICAL)
1. **91.3% of type mismatch errors involve `unknown` type** (137/150)
2. **50.7% of all errors come from ONE file** (tun-satiroglu.pine: 178/339)
3. **Many "undefined variable" errors are FALSE POSITIVES** - variables ARE declared but validator doesn't find them in complex contexts

## Error Category Analysis

### 1. Type Mismatch Errors (150 total, 44.2% of all errors)

**Patterns (Top 10):**
```
[12x] and: unknown and unknown
[10x] and: unknown and bool
[10x] and: bool and unknown
[ 8x] <: unknown and unknown
[ 6x] >: series<float> and unknown
[ 6x] *: unknown and float
[ 6x] -: series<float> and unknown
[ 5x] <: series<float> and unknown
[ 5x] >: unknown and unknown
[ 4x] >: unknown and int
```

**Critical Finding:**
- **91.3% involve `unknown` type** (137/150)
- Only 8.7% are legitimate type errors (e.g., `string + string`, wrong function argument types)

**Root Cause:**
Variables are being declared but their types aren't being inferred correctly, leading to `unknown` type propagation.

---

### 2. Undefined Variable Errors (168 total, 49.6% of all errors)

**Most Common:**
```
[13x] 'showindis'   - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:365
[12x] 'by'          - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:422
[ 8x] 'searchdiv'   - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:482
[ 7x] 'plotLevels'  - demo/multi-tf-fvg.pine:38
[ 6x] 'orbActive'   - mysample.v6.pine:91, indicator.2.3.pine:98
[ 6x] 'prd'         - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:383
[ 6x] 'y'           - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:619
[ 5x] 'longStopPrev' - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:121
[ 5x] 'dontconfirm' - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:419
[ 4x] 'repaint'     - demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:201
```

**CRITICAL FINDING: Many are FALSE POSITIVES**

Variables that ARE declared but validator reports as undefined:
- ✗ `showindis` - line 300: `showindis = input.string(...)`
- ✗ `searchdiv` - line 299: `searchdiv = input.string(...)`
- ✗ `prd` - line 297: `prd = input.int(...)`
- ✗ `longStopPrev` - line 117: `longStopPrev = nz(longStop[1], longStop)`
- ✗ `dontconfirm` - line 306: `dontconfirm = input(...)`
- ✗ `repaint` - line 181: `repaint = input.bool(...)`
- ✗ `y` - lines 231-232: `var float y2 = na`, `var float y1 = na`

**Pattern:** These variables ARE in the source but aren't accessible when used later (often in different contexts or scopes).

---

### 3. Condition Type Errors (16 total, 4.7% of all errors)

**Pattern:** `Condition must be boolean, got unknown`

**Examples:**
```
test-v6-features.pine:212 - if rsi > 70 (rsi is unknown)
demo/tun-satiroglu.pine:120 - if doji4price (doji4price is unknown)
```

**Root Cause:** Variables have `unknown` type, so conditions can't be validated as boolean.

---

## Isolated Testing Results

### Test 1: User-Defined Functions ✅ WORKING
```pine
f_double(x) => x * 2
f_quadruple(x) => f_double(x) * 2
result1 = f_double(5)
result2 = f_quadruple(10)
```
**Result:** 0 errors. Return types correctly inferred.

### Test 2: Input Functions ✅ WORKING (in isolation)
```pine
showindis = input.string(defval = 'test', title = 'Show')
prd = input.int(defval = 5, title = 'Period')
if prd > 0 and showindis == 'test'
    plot(close)
```
**Result:** 0 errors in isolation.

### Test 3: Complex Context ❌ FAILS (in real files)
Same pattern as Test 2, but in tun-satiroglu.pine with 700+ lines:
- Variables declared at top level
- Used 60+ lines later in if statement
- Validator reports "undefined"

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Issue 1: Large File Parsing/Scoping
**Hypothesis:** In files with many statements (90+ top-level statements like tun-satiroglu.pine), the validator may have issues:
1. Collecting all declarations before validation
2. Maintaining scope across long distances
3. Handling complex nesting

**Evidence:**
- Small files (debug-test.pine: 3 statements) = 0 errors
- Large files (tun-satiroglu.pine: 95 statements) = 178 errors
- Isolated tests of same patterns = 0 errors

### Issue 2: Two-Pass Collection Missing Statements
The `collectDeclarations()` method may not be processing all statements before validation runs.

**Possible causes:**
- Early return on certain statement types
- Not recursing into all nested structures
- Order of operations (validation before collection completes)

### Issue 3: Scope Lookup Depth Limits
Symbol table lookup might have issues finding variables declared in parent scope when deeply nested.

---

## What Works (No Issues Found)

✅ **User-defined function return type inference**
✅ **Variable declarations (in small files)**
✅ **Input function declarations (in isolation)**
✅ **Basic type inference for literals, built-ins**
✅ **Control flow parsing (if/else/for/while)**
✅ **Function parameter scoping**
✅ **Array/index access type inference (Session 5)**
✅ **Namespace properties (Session 5)**

---

## What Doesn't Work

❌ **Variable recognition in large/complex files**
❌ **Type inference for variables with complex initializers**
❌ **Scope lookup across long statement lists**
❌ **Handling of `var type name = value` patterns** (e.g., `var float y2 = na`)

---

## Priority Recommendations (Revised)

### Priority 6 (HIGH IMPACT): Fix Large File Variable Recognition
**Target:** 339 → ~220 errors (-119, -35%)

**Problem:** Variables declared but not found in complex contexts

**Approach:**
1. Add comprehensive logging to `collectDeclarations()` to see what's being collected
2. Verify two-pass is running for ALL top-level statements
3. Test with progressively larger files to find breaking point
4. Fix scope lookup to handle deep nesting

**Expected Impact:**
- tun-satiroglu.pine: 178 → ~80 errors (-98)
- Other files: -21 errors total

### Priority 7 (MEDIUM IMPACT): Better Unknown Type Handling
**Target:** ~220 → ~180 errors (-40, -18%)

**Problem:** Variables get `unknown` type, cascade to 137 type mismatch errors

**Approach:**
1. Improve type inference for complex initializers (ternary with `unknown`, etc.)
2. Add more built-in function return types
3. Better handling of `var type name = value` syntax

### Priority 8 (LOW IMPACT): Edge Case Cleanup
**Target:** ~180 → ~150 errors (-30, -17%)

**Problem:** Legitimate errors in test files

**Examples:**
- `string + string` operations
- Missing required parameters
- Wrong argument counts

**Approach:** Fix validator rules for these specific patterns

## Test Quality Assessment

### Good Test Coverage
- ✅ Examples cover real-world use cases (trading indicators)
- ✅ Mix of simple and complex files
- ✅ Test fixtures for both valid and invalid code
- ✅ Pine Script v6 features tested

### Gaps in Test Coverage
- ❌ No incremental tests (small → medium → large files)
- ❌ No isolated feature tests (only complex integrated tests)
- ❌ Missing baseline tests for each parser/validator feature
- ❌ No regression tests for Sessions 2-5 improvements

### Recommended Test Additions

1. **Unit Tests:** Individual features in isolation
   ```
   test/unit/
     - variable-declarations.pine
     - function-return-types.pine
     - type-inference.pine
     - scope-lookup.pine
   ```

2. **Integration Tests:** Progressive complexity
   ```
   test/integration/
     - small-file-10-statements.pine
     - medium-file-50-statements.pine
     - large-file-100-statements.pine
   ```

3. **Regression Tests:** One test per session fix
   ```
   test/regression/
     - session-2-variadic-functions.pine
     - session-3-type-inference.pine
     - session-4-control-flow.pine
     - session-5-advanced-types.pine
   ```

## Conclusions

### What We Learned

1. **User-defined functions work** - Priority 5 assumption was wrong
2. **One file accounts for 50% of errors** - tun-satiroglu.pine (178/339)
3. **Validator has scaling issues** - works on small files, fails on large files
4. **Many errors are false positives** - variables declared but not found

### What Should Be Done Next

**CRITICAL:** Don't implement Priority 5 (user-defined functions) - it already works!

**INSTEAD:**
1. Investigate why large files have variable recognition failures
2. Add logging/debugging to understand `collectDeclarations()` behavior
3. Fix scope lookup or two-pass collection
4. Validate with incremental tests (small → large)

### Session 6 Deliverables

1. ✅ Comprehensive analysis of all test files
2. ✅ Identified systemic vs edge case issues
3. ✅ Quantified error patterns and concentration
4. ✅ Tested assumptions about user-defined functions
5. ✅ Created investigation scripts and test cases
6. ✅ Revised priority recommendations
